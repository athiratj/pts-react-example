# Using Pts with create-react-app

[Pts](https://github.com/williamngan/pts) is a typescript/javascript library for visualization and creative-coding. Get started at [ptsjs.org](https://ptsjs.org).

This project provides examples of using Pts in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) components. It's built with Facebook's popular [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool.

Also review the README in the [main repo folder](https://github.com/williamngan/pts-react-example/) for other build options.
